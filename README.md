## üéØ How to Use

### Free Pose Mode
1. Select "Free Pose" from the sidebar
2. Allow camera permissions when prompted
3. Stand in front of the camera with your full body visible
4. Watch as the AI detects and draws your pose skeleton in real-time

### Squat Counter Mode
1. Select "Squat Counter" from the sidebar
2. Position yourself 6-8 feet from the camera
3. Ensure your full body is visible in the frame
4. Start performing squats - the AI will:
   - Count your repetitions automatically
   - Provide real-time form feedback
   - Give voice guidance (if enabled)
   - Track your accuracy score

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Features

### Sidebar Controls
- **Activity Selector**: Choose between "Free Pose" and "Squat Counter"
- **Voice Feedback**: Toggle audio guidance on/off
- **Reset Counter**: Clear current workout session
- **Save Workout**: Store your session data

### Workout Statistics
- **Repetition Counter**: Real-time rep counting
- **Current Stage**: Shows "UP" or "DOWN" position
- **Knee Angle**: Live angle measurement
- **Form Accuracy**: Performance score with progress bar
- **Feedback Messages**: Real-time form corrections

## üîß Technical Details

### AI & Computer Vision
- **MediaPipe Pose**: Google's ML framework for pose detection

- **Angle Calculation**: Mathematical analysis using cosine rule
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for live video streams

### Exercise Detection Logic
- **Squat Recognition**: Based on knee and hip angle analysis
- **Threshold Detection**: Angles below 90¬∞ count as proper depth
- **Stage Tracking**: Monitors "up" and "down" phases
- **Form Feedback**: Provides guidance for better technique

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized for real-time performance
- **Smart Caching**: Reduces computational overhead
- **Adaptive Quality**: Adjusts based on system capabilities

## üé® User Interface

### Main Features
- **Live Camera Feed**: Real-time video with pose overlay
- **Interactive Sidebar**: All controls and statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Clean Layout**: Beginner-friendly interface

### Visual Feedback
- **Pose Skeleton**: Green landmarks and red connections
- **Text Overlays**: Rep count, stage, and angle information
- **Progress Bars**: Visual accuracy indicators
- **Status Indicators**: Connection and detection status

## üîä Audio Features

### Voice Feedback System
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses pyttsx3 for audio guidance
- **Smart Timing**: Provides feedback at appropriate moments
- **Customizable**: Can be toggled on/off
- **Form Corrections**: Audio cues for better technique

### Feedback Messages
- "Great squat!" - Perfect form completion
- "Squat deeper!" - Needs more depth
- "Perfect depth! Now stand up!" - Good bottom position
- "Keep going down!" - Transitioning to squat

## üìä Data & Analytics

### Workout Tracking
- **Session Data**: Reps, accuracy, timestamp
- **CSV Export**: Automatic data saving
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track improvement over time
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed accuracy scoring

### Accuracy Scoring
- **Form Analysis**: Based on proper squat mechanics
- **Real-time Updates**: Score changes with performance
- **Feedback Integration**: Linked to voice guidance

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera Not Working**
- Allow camera permissions in browser settings
- Check if camera is being used by other applications
- Try refreshing the page

**Pose Not Detected**
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Stand with full body visible in frame
